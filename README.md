D&D Forge is a front-end web application designed to assist Dungeons & Dragons players and Dungeon Masters. Using the power of the Google Gemini API, the tool generates character portraits and detailed backstories from user-provided prompts.
This project was designed to be a creative and inspirational tool, demonstrating a modern integration between a reactive user interface and generative artificial intelligence services.

Detailed Character Creation: A complete form to enter Name, Age, Race, Class, Pronouns, and a detailed description.
AI Image Generation: Creates unique and stylized character portraits based on the form data.
AI Backstory Generation: Crafts cohesive and creative backstories that incorporate all character details, including their pronouns.
Intuitive Navigation: A multi-page interface, including a home page, the character creation area, and "About" and "Contact" pages.
"Quick Prompt" Generator: A feature to instantly generate a character concept (name, race, class, etc.), which can then be used to generate a full character.
Responsive Design: Interface built with Tailwind CSS and daisyUI, fully functional on mobile devices and desktops.

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dnd-generator.git

# Navigate to the project folder
cd dnd-generator

# Install the dependencies
npm install


## 2. Setting up Environment Variables
In the root directory of the project, create a file named .env.
Inside the .env file, add your API key from Google AI Studio. The variable name must start with VITE_.
VITE_API_KEY="YOUR_SUPER_SECRET_API_KEY_HERE"


## 3. Running the Application
After configuring the .env file, you can start the development server.
# Start the React application with Vite
npm run dev


The application will be accessible at http://localhost:5173 (or the port that Vite indicates in your terminal).
